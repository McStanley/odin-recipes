            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p class="content-text">
                With a cheese-stuffed crust and an egg baked into the center, this boat-shaped 
                Georgian bread is so fun and versatile, it's only a matter of time before 
                it's delivered to every home for pizza night and ordered from every brunch menu 
                the morning after.</p>
            <p class="content-text">
                They take a little finesse but the payoff is well worth it; 
                after all, what more could you want other than cheesy, soft-while-chewy bread 
                dipped in its own bed of runny egg yolk and molten cheese?
            </p>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol class="content-text">
                    <li>
                        Combine milk, water, sugar, and yeast in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast softens 
                        and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. Add olive oil, 2 cups flour, and 
                        salt. Mix until a sticky dough comes together.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead for about 3 minutes, adding in 
                        remaining flour as needed, until dough is very soft but still workable. Form into a ball 
                        and place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in 
                        volume, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Combine Monterey Jack, 
                        mozzarella, and feta cheeses in a bowl. Toss together and refrigerate until needed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Punch down dough and turn out onto a floured surface. Flatten slightly and cut in 
                        half. Dust a large sheet of parchment paper with flour. Place 1 dough half on top and 
                        roll out into a square about 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick, stretching out the corners as 
                        needed. Arrange 1/4 of the cheese in 2 rows, 1 to 2 inches from the longest sides. Roll 
                        sides up tightly over the cheese, forming a canoe shape around the dough. Pinch and 
                        twist ends to seal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cut off excess parchment around the dough; lift dough onto a baking sheet. Repeat 
                        shaping and stuffing the other dough half. Fill the canoe with the remaining cheese mixture.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Form a well in the center of each 
                        khachapuri using a spoon; crack an egg inside each well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Return to oven and bake until eggs are mostly set, 3 to 4 minutes. Place 2 pats of 
                        butter over each filling and sprinkle salt and cayenne on top. Plate khachapuri; tear 
                        off one end and use it to stir the butter into the egg.
                    </li>
                </ol>
