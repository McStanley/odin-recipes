        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            With a cheese-stuffed crust and an egg baked into the center, this boat-shaped 
            Georgian bread is so fun and versatile, it's only a matter of time <br>before 
            it's delivered to every home for pizza night and ordered from every brunch menu 
            the morning after.</p>
        <p>
            They take a little finesse but the payoff is well worth it; 
            after all, what more could you want other than cheesy, <br>soft-while-chewy bread 
            dipped in its own bed of runny egg yolk and molten cheese?
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the Dough:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup warm milk</li>
            <li>⅓ cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Cheese Blend:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>4 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>8 ounces feta cheese, crumbled</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Rest:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, cut into 4 pats</li>
            <li>sea salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine milk, water, sugar, and yeast in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast softens 
                <br>and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. Add olive oil, 2 cups flour, and 
                <br>salt. Mix until a sticky dough comes together.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead for about 3 minutes, adding in 
                <br>remaining flour as needed, until dough is very soft but still workable. Form into a ball 
                <br>and place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in 
                <br>volume, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Combine Monterey Jack, 
                <br>mozzarella, and feta cheeses in a bowl. Toss together and refrigerate until needed.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Punch down dough and turn out onto a floured surface. Flatten slightly and cut in 
                <br>half. Dust a large sheet of parchment paper with flour. Place 1 dough half on top and 
                <br>roll out into a square about 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick, stretching out the corners as 
                <br>needed. Arrange 1/4 of the cheese in 2 rows, 1 to 2 inches from the longest sides. Roll 
                <br>sides up tightly over the cheese, forming a canoe shape around the dough. Pinch and 
                <br>twist ends to seal.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Cut off excess parchment around the dough; lift dough onto a baking sheet. Repeat 
                <br>shaping and stuffing the other dough half. Fill the canoe with the remaining cheese <br>mixture.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Form a well in the center of each 
                <br>khachapuri using a spoon; crack an egg inside each well.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Return to oven and bake until eggs are mostly set, 3 to 4 minutes. Place 2 pats of 
                <br>butter over each filling and sprinkle salt and cayenne on top. Plate khachapuri; tear 
                <br>off one end and use it to stir the butter into the egg.</li>
        </ol>
